    SharURL is a quick and easy way to share your files with friends and family.
    Simply select the files you want to share from your computer and a short,
    unique URL will be created to download those files.

    <h3>How do you share large files?</h3>
    <p>
        Do you send multiple emails? Maybe you burn a CD? Either way, it's a
        terrible hassle. With SharURL, you just open your web browser and a few
        clicks later you have a URL to share your files.

    <h3>A replacement for email attachments</h3>
    <p>
        Sending email with large attachments is unreliable and frustrating. The
        idea for SharURL grew out of this frustration. There was a real need for
        a simple web interface allowing anyone to easily upload photos,
        documents, or whatever files they wish.
